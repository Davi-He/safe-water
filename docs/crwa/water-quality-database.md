# EPA Water Quality Database

The CRWA submits data to the [EPA's water quality database](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/water-quality-data-wqx).

### What's in the data?
The Safe Water Act requires various local, state, and federal agencies to monitor lakes, streams, rivers and other of bodies of water for their quality.

### Formatting and uploading the data
The CRWA's data looks a lot different than the format for the data that the EPA requires. You can find more information about this process in the "Upload Data" tab of the Water Quality Data page on the EPA's website.

At the moment, we are currently working through the EPA's documentation, which is very long. Part of our needs for the data modernization task is to learn more about the process that the EPA requires, and summarize it.
