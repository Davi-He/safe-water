### Benthic macroinvertibrate (BMI)
Benthic macroinvertibrates are small aquatic animals and aquatic larval stages of insects that are large enough to see without a microscope.  They are typically found at the bottom of rivers.  Benthic means "bottom dwelling."  They are fairly easy to collect and/or observe and therefore are a convenient way to assess the biological healthfulness of a river (source:  EPA website)

### Blue-green algae:  
(this is an alternative term for Cyanobacteria)

### Cyanobacteria
It is normal for Cyanobacteria to be in water.  A Cyanobacteria bloom is when cyanobacteria has grown very quickly, typically due to fertilizer runoff or septic tank overflows.  Cyanobacteria blooms prevent other life in the river from getting oxygen or sunlight.  Cyanobacteria blooms also create toxins, referred to as cyanotoxins (source: CDC website)

### E-coli
a common bacteria found in the stomachs of animals (including humans).  Detection of e-coli in freshwater usually indicates contamination by fecal matter from a warm blooded animal (source: USGS website)
