# CWRA Data Collection Process

### Volunteer Monthly Monitoring Program (VMM)

- 1. The CRWA collects water samples from 36 sites on the Charles River on the third Tuesday of every month around 6:00am. There are two volunteers per site.
- 2. The data is sent to a lab (currently the MRWA). The lab takes some time to analyze the results, and then it sends back the results of the tests. (We currently do not know what the results of these tests look like.)
- 3. The raw version of the results of these tests is stored on the CRWA's Google Drive.
- 4. This data is tested and then merged into their Access database.
