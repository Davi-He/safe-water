### Safe Water Project

# Charles River Watershed Association (CRWA)

The Charles River Watershed Association (CRWA) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that "strives to protect, restore, and enhance the Charles River and its watershed through science, advocacy, and law." In 2020, the Safe Water Project is collaborating with the CRWA to provide expertise in addressing some of their challenges related to data processes, data visualization, and other data-related tasks.

# Background

As a small nonprofit, CRWA is constrained on the amount that it would love to be able to do. A lot of those tasks relate to data, which is where we come in.

# Projects and Tasks

After an initial connection, Lisa from Charles River Watershed Association (CRWA) proposed a few projects to the Code for Boston (CfB) safe-water group. Volunteers of the safe-water expressed their interests in collaborating with a non-profit environmental organization and are currently working on two projects to support the health of the local river and the communication of river quality data to the public.


## 1. Flagging Program

Of the many services that the CRWA provides to the greater Boston community, one of those is monitoring whether it is safe to swim and/or boat in the Charles River. Traditionally, this was accomplished by running some live river data through a predictive model hosted on a PHP website and outputting the results through that PHP website. However, that website is currently out of commission. We are focusing now on building a new website in Python + Flask. The results -flags- are displayed on [CRWA's website](https://www.crwa.org/flagging-program.html) for the public and local boathouses.

The flagging project has [a separate repo](https://github.com/codeforboston/flagging), visit it to learn more about this project!

## 2. Data Visualization and Data Sharing Tool

Another team is working on a "data visualization and data sharing tool". The purpose of the tool is to share data in a way that is both accessible and useful in order to engage stakeholders to make data-driven decisions in their lives and communities, while also giving the possibility to CRWA to communicate about and with its data to engage with stakeholders.  

We are a group of user researchers, designers, data visualization specialists, and data analysts working on a visualization tool that will help CRWA share its data with the public.  

We are currently conducting user research and doing design work, so our work is not on GitHub. You can join us by joining our [Slack channel](https://communityinviter.com/apps/cfb-public/code-for-boston) (#water).
