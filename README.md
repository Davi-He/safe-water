# Safe Water Project ðŸš°

The Safe Water Project is a team of volunteers at [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/) who are using data modeling, data visualization and machine learning to predict, visualize, and share data about the presence of hazardous drinking and surface water contaminants in the United States. 

#### We are interested in collaborating with health and environmental organizations.

Representatives for nonprofit organizations and government agencies interested in our work should contact Andrew at andrew@codeforboston.org. Please feel free to also join our Slack channel at Code for Boston and meet the team.

## Our Work

### Institutional Partners

The Safe Water Project works with Boston-based community partners. These organizations have needs related to data infrastructure and data science, and we provide our expertise in assisting them.   

**Currently we work with the [Charles River Watershed Association](https://www.crwa.org/).** We help them deploying their predictive model, visualizing and communicating their data, as well as better understanding their constituents. You can learn more about this project [in the related folder](https://github.com/codeforboston/safe-water/tree/master/projects/crwa).

Most volunteers work in [python](http://python.org) with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). Some volunteers also use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), or PHP.
